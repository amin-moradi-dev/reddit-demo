1) Done / Not Done since last scrum
- Finalized vote endpoints (idempotent behavior; returns {score, userVote}); added error codes for unauthenticated users.
- Implemented image upload for posts (UUID + original extension) to /uploads, stored imageUrl in DB.
- Not done: security rules for who can delete posts/comments.

2) Plan (next 24h)
- Add Spring Security method rules (@PreAuthorize) and integrate login-required flows for create/vote.
- Expose /profile/{id} and /myprofile read endpoints.

3) Needs/Blockers
- Confirm max upload size and allowed image types for frontend validation.
