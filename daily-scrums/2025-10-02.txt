Fatemeh Zarezadeh Mehrizi

1) Done / Not Done since last scrum
- Implemented UserService, PostService, CommunityService, VoteService and wired controllers to services.
- Added AJAX voting endpoints: POST /api/post/{id}/upvote & POST /api/post/{id}/downvote (JSON response with new score).
- Enabled sorting parameters on feed (?sort=new|hot) and basic search by title (/search?q=...).
- Not done: rate-limiting on votes; pagination on comments thread.

2) Plan (next 24h)
- Add pagination to home/community feeds and post comments.
- Implement “hot” ranking (score + decay) more formally.
- Add unit tests for VoteService and controller happy-paths.

3) Needs/Blockers
- Confirm final response shape for votes used by frontend (e.g., {score, userVote}).
